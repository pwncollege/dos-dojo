Welcome back to the 1990s!
First time here?
No problem!

In the early 90s, the primary PC operating system was Microsoft's Disk Operating System, DOS.
DOS has a long and storied [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS), and through its simple design and elegant operation, fortunes were made and hackers were inspired.
Now it's your turn.

Throughout the DOS Dojo, you will learn DOS from the basics to the advanced!
Go and experience history!

**NOTE:** This dojo is still being developed! Check this space in a day or two for challenges!
