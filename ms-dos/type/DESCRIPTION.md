Let's start with the basics!

You interact with DOS using the commandline.
I'm sure you're quite familiar with `cat /flag` in Linux (and if not, you can [learn it](/linux-luminarium)!).
In DOS, the `cat` equivalent is `type`.
Like `cat`'s default usage, `type` _types_ out the file contents to the screen.

Let's dig in!
The flag is in the `flag.txt` file of the `C:` drive.
What the heck is the C drive?
Roughly speaking, it's the DOS equivalent of `/`: it's the primary disk of the machine.

So, boot up your DOS (using `/challenge/launch`), and read the flag!
