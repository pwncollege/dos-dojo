Until now, you have used DOS.
Now, it's time to install it!
You can use the provided floppies to install MS-DOS 6.22.
Note that since each floppy only holds 1.44mb, it was necessary to ship software in _multiple_ floppies.
MS-DOS 6.22 used three disks, and you'll need to do some floppy juggling via the QEMU text interface to get everything set up.

Anyways, go install MS-DOS 6.22, load the flag floppy, and read the flag!
