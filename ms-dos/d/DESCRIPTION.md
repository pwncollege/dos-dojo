So, `C:`...
What if you have more than one disk?
In Linux, you'd "mount" it somewhere in the filesystem, such as `/media/mydisk`, but in DOS, every disk gets its own drive letter.
A second hard drive will be named `D:`!

In this level, we loaded up the flag to `D:`.
How to switch drives?
Just type the letter and a colon:

```text
C:\> P:
P:\>
```

Of course, we don't have a P drive, but we do have a D drive, and there's a flag in there!
Go get it!
