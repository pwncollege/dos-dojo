In this module, you'll learn some of the quirks of an operating system with one large shared memory space.
This module will test your C development skills.
To that end, we've made life a bit easier:

1. We installed TurboC++ for you in `C:\TC`.
2. We synchronize your `/home/hacker/d:` directory with the `D:` drive when you start the challenge, when you change files in DOS, and when you stop the challenge.

Hopefully this helps make life easy!
